      <h4>Background</h4>

      <p>
        Alice Cogswell was a 9-years old girl who was part of the developement of American Sign Language and the Deaf Education in America.
        She was born in 1805 to Mason Cogswell and Mary Austin Ledyard. Her father was Dr.Mason Fitch Cogswell who was a renowned doctor who perform the cataract surgery.
        When she was two years old, she became ill which cause her to lose her hearing and eventually her speech. 
        In 1814,her father Dr.Congswell their neighbor was young preacher who graduated from 
        Andover Theological Seminary. Due to his chronic lung illness, he was returned home to his family.
        While he was home, he learned that the girl was Deaf. When he met her officially, he was determined to communicate with her. 
        Alice was having some success on learning how to spell and read. Although, Gallaudet need a effective way to teach and educate a deaf child.

      <h4>Contribution</h4>


      <p>
        So, Dr.Cogswell asked Thomas if he would be travel to Europe and learn how to teach his daughter. Thomas agreed 
        to go and to learn the method of reading lips and speaking. But Thomas have other things in mind because he didn't believe that speaking a natural for them.
        while he was in London, he have seen the lecture that was taught by Abbe Siccard who taught French Sign Language to Deaf pupils at the 
        National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris (or the National Institute for Deaf Children of Paris) that was founded by Abbe de L’Eppe who was also known as “The Father of the Deaf.” 
        Gallaudet was so fascinated with Siccard teaching, so he come up with the idea of starting a school for the Deaf in America. So Abbe Siccard invited Thomas to his school,
        and gather as much resource to take to America. After a few months, it comes to a point where Thomas knew he can't do it all alone. So he invited Laurent Clerc to sail with
        him to Connecticut,America and to help him to Teach Alice. On the ship, Clerc taught Thomas Sign Language and Thomas taught Clerc how to read and write in English. 
        When they arrive, Alice was so excited to see Thomas and meet Thomas's new friend Laurent Clerc. Clerc quickly began working on teaching Alice.
