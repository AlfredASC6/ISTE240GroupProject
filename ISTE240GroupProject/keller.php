            Helen Keller, born as Helen Adams Keller was an Americam author, disability rights advocate, political acitvist and lecturer.
            She was born on June 27, 1880 in West Tuscumbia Alabama. Her father was Arthur Henley Keller and her mother was Cathreine
            Everett (Adams) Keller. She had four siblings total and two full siblings: Mildred Campbell (Keller) Tyson and Philip 
            Brooks Keller. She had two older half siblings from her father's first marriage: James McDonald Keller and William 
            Simpson Keller. At 19 months old she contracted an unkown illness that doctors would describe as "an acute congestion 
            of the stomach and the brain". The illness left Keller both deaf and blind. She was able to communicate with the 
            daughter of the family cook using her own "home signs". By age 7 she had over 60 home signs that allowed her to 
            communicate with the people in her family and she could also distiguish people by the vibration of their footsteps.
