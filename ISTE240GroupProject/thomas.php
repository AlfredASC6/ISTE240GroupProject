      Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, (born Dec. 10, 1787, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died Sept. 10, 1851, Hartford, Conn.), educational 
      philanthropist and founder of the first American school for the deaf.
After graduating from Yale College in 1805, Gallaudet studied theology at Andover. His interests soon turned to the education 
of the deaf, and he visited Europe, studying in England and France, where he learned the sign method of communication from Abbé Roch-Ambroise Sicard, head of the French Royal Institute for the Deaf. On Gallaudet’s return to the United States in 1816, he and Laurent Clerc established the American Asylum for Deaf-mutes at Hartford, Conn., in support of which the U.S. Congress made a land grant. For more than 50 years this school was the main training centre for instructors of the deaf.
Gallaudet retired from the school in 1830, later receiving an appointment to the first professorship in the United States for 
the philosophy of education at New York University (1832–33). In his Plan of a Seminary for the Education of Instructers of
 Youth (1825), he proposed special schools for the professional training of teachers. He also wrote textbooks for children 
 and the deaf.

      <p>
      Gallaudet was the youngest of eight children born to Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet—who had helped found the Connecticut Asylum 
      for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons (now called the American School for the Deaf), which was the first 
      permanent American school for the deaf—and Sophia Fowler Gallaudet, a woman who had attended the institution. While studying 
      at Trinity College (B.S., 1856) in Hartford, Edward taught part-time at the Connecticut Asylum. In 1857 he became 
      superintendent of the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind in Washington, D.C., a 
      school that Amos Kendall had founded. In 1864 Gallaudet and others successfully petitioned the U.S. Congress to allow the
       school to grant college degrees; Pres. Abraham Lincoln signed the charter into law. Gallaudet served as president
        (1864–1910) of the expanded institution, later called Gallaudet University
