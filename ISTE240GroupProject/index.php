            The history of Deafness and the Deaf community is long, and it comes with many periods of misunderstanding, oppression, and discrimination. 
            The history also comes with great resilience, beauty, and strength. The Deaf community, denoted with the capital 'D' as a cultural and linguistic minority, 
            has a rich culture and gorgeous language, American Sign Language. We invite you to learn more. All the pictures and icons have links to additional information. 
            As you read, please note the use of historical terms that are not appropriate today. For example, deaf-mute is an offensive term as is hearing impaired. 
            The correct terms are Deaf (cultural and linguistic minority), deaf (physical hearing loss, moderate to profound), hard of hearing (mild to moderate hearing loss), and Deaf-Blind 
            (may be hard of hearing or deaf with low vision to complete blindness).

            This image shows us the percentage of people with hearing loss by age and how severe it is.
            The figures represent how common it is to have hearing loss as age increases. 1 in 10 people experience hearing 
            loss by the age of 50, and the figure seems to be doubling withing every 10 years of an age gap.
